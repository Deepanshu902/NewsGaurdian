NewsGuardian is a Chrome browser extension designed to help users critically evaluate online content. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models, this tool provides a rapid credibility analysis of any selected text, helping to combat the spread of misinformation in a real-time browsing environment.

## üöÄ About The Project

In today's digital age, distinguishing fact from fiction is more challenging than ever. NewsGuardian was built to empower users with a first-pass analysis of news articles, headlines, or any online text. Simply highlight the text, click the extension icon, and receive an instant breakdown of its potential for being misleading, including a percentage score and a list of reasons for the analysis.

### The Vision: Real-time Fact-Checking with X (Twitter) Data

The ultimate vision for NewsGuardian is to integrate with a model like **xAI's Grok**. The key advantage of Grok is its real-time access to the vast dataset of X (formerly Twitter), which would allow the extension to:
* Check if a breaking news story is being corroborated by multiple trusted sources simultaneously.
* Analyze the public discourse and sentiment around a topic.
* Instantly identify if a claim originates from a known source of misinformation.

Due to API credit limitations on paid, state-of-the-art models, this public version utilizes a powerful free model available through the OpenRouter API. However, the core architecture is built to be model-agnostic, ready to be pointed at a more advanced API like Grok's when feasible.
